# Introduction

The [MarketPlace platform](https://www.materials-marketplace.eu/) has been developed as part of [the MarketPlace project](https://www.the-marketplace-project.eu/), funded by the Horizon 2020 program (call H2020-NMBP-25-2017, grant agreement number 760173).

The MarketPlace impacts the entire modelling community, including model developers as well as translators and software vendors as it addresses the need of designing products that serve the multitude of customer needs.

It aims to become a central-hub for all these actors:
A web-based collaboration platform that links all the different elements and enables the advancement of the European manufacturing industry.
Advanced workflows are being integrated in order to connect the inputs and outputs of the relevant processes in a standardized way, making the flow of information part of the solution rather than the problem.
